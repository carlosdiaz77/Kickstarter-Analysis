# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project.

This project is a good opportunity to work with data from Kickstarter.
**But what is Kickstarter?** Well, it is a funding platform for creative projects.
Every project creator sets their project's funding goal and deadline. 
If people like the project, they can pledge money to make it happen. 
If the project succeeds in reaching its funding goal, all backers' credit cards are charged when time expires.

For this exercise we will analyze how plays did interms of percentage of success and failure in different goal group.
We will also analyze the outcomes of the theater outcomes by launch date.
_You can access [Kickstarter here](https://www.kickstarter.com/)._


### Purpose

- The objective of this challenge is to utilize the excel skills  that we learned in Module 1.
- We'll also start analyzing the visualizations (Pivot Graphs) in order to be able to tell a story based on the data.



## Analysis and Challenges

- We had the opportunity to analyze the graphs and be able to get some interesting insights from them.
- An important challenge is to determine if the amounts in goal and pledged colunms are dollarized, There is a column that states <currency>
- For this excercise I will asume the amounts are dollarized
 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

-The specific challenge in this activity was creating the pivot table and the graph at the same time.
-I used to create first the pivot table and then  create the graph but i had the opportunity to make both at the same time.
-I was a good opportunity to see how the pivot table creates the years and quarters groups by default at the moment you drag and drop the dates to the rows field.
--You can see the image of [Outcomes Based on launch date](Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) here.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

-The challenge in this activity was to use the function COUNTIFs, personally I had used only the COUNTIF but being able to determine several conditions in different columns was great.
-I thinks using the <Find the replace> option helped me to just copy the formula and just replace the criteria where it had the be different
-Using the absolute position of in the formulas helps a lot to be able to copy and paste the formula and make sure that it still works well



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

-I found these tasks very interesting, Even when I have used excel a lot I could definitely find new things to learn.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

	-We can clearly see that the events that are launched in the months of May , Jun and Jul have a better success/fail ratio . The weather could be a factor here.
	-We can also see there are fewer events launched in the months of Nov, Dec and Jan and that the success/fail ratio drops drastically in December

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	-We can clearly see the higher the goal the higher the probability of failure.
	-We can see that if the goal is less than $20,000 the chances of success are higher.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

	There is no demographic data of the backers, this could help.

	

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

	-We could create a graph that also refers to the how long the project was open. (death line date- Lauch date)This would help us determine if the factor of having the project longer helps achieving the goal.
	-We could use the backer-count and the average donation amount to determine what events had more or less popularity  and where backers where more generous
